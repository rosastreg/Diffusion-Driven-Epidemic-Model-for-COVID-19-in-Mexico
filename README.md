# Undergrad_AM_Thesis
The aim of this thesis is to perform Bayesian filtering and parameter inference in a non-linear system of diferential equations. Particularly, we shall conduct inference within the context of State Space Models using the compartmental SUIRD epidemiological model for the transition equations. 

Overall, our main objectives are to:
1. Estimate the "true" number of unidentified individuals,
2. Estimate the time varying parameters of the model.
